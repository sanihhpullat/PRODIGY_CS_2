XOR Image Encryptor/Decryptor (Python)

This is a simple image encryption and decryption program made as part of my Prodigy InfoTech internship. The program uses a numeric key to encrypt or decrypt images using the XOR operation. It works with PNG or JPG images, and the same key can be used to reverse the encryption.
