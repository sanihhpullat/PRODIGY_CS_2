# XOR Image Encryptor/Decryptor (Python)

This is a simple image encryption and decryption program made as part of my Prodigy InfoTech internship. The program uses a numeric key to encrypt or decrypt images using the XOR operation. It works with PNG or JPG images, and the same key can be used to reverse the encryption.  

## How to Use
1. Run the script in Python
2. Enter the input image file name (example: myphoto.png)
3. Enter the output image file name (example: encrypted.png)
4. Enter a key number between 0–255
5. The program will create the encrypted or decrypted image

Example:
Input Image: myphoto.png  
Output Image: encrypted.png  
Key: 50  
Result: encrypted.png will be scrambled; using the same key again on this file will decrypt it
